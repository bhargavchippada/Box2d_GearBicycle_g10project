##Steps

1. Download all the files in the github project (click on "Download Zip" button). Extract it.
2. In the extracted folder u will find the latest src folder, Makefile, README.md and cs296_base_code.tar.gz 
3. Extract cs296_base_code.tar.gz
4. The src folder and Makefile inside the extracted cs296_base_code folder may not be up-to-date!!!
5. So replace the src folder and Makefile inside cs296_base_code folder with the **latest** src folder and Makefile from the extracted folder of step 1 and 2 above.
6. Open your bash terminal and go into the cs296_base_code folder and do run "ls" command. If u find Makefile listed then you are in the current directory.
7. Now run "make exe". This will build the required files and compile the code. This will take little time to finish.
8. Now run "ls" command again. U will observe that new folders got created. You will find a folder called "mybins" listed.
9. Now go into mybins folder by running "cd mybins". Now run the executable file inside it. If u do "ls" u will find the executable named "cs296_10_exe" inside it.
10. U can run the executable file from bash with the command "./cs296_10_exe"

###How to Play
